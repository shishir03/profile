<h2>Overview</h2>
Throughout high school, I have worked on multiple coding projects - some as part of school and some independently, either to simplify daily tasks such as recording and processing data or just for fun.
<h2>APCS Projects</h2>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/shishir03/game_of_life">Game of Life</a>: This program implements the popular cellular automaton Conway's Game of Life. The "game" is laid out on a grid, where filled in cells are alive and empty cells are dead. Live cells with less than two or more than three living neighbors die, while dead cells with three living neighbors become alive. Specific initial patterns can either cause repeating patterns or very long, nonrepeating sequences.</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/shishir03/netflix_prize">Netflix Prize</a>: Close to the end of the year, our class held a contest inspired by the 2009 Netflix Prize contest to see who could come up with a better movie recommendation algorithm. The task was to design an algorithm that could predict the rating (in stars) a user would give a certain movie with the lowest RMSE (root mean square error). My code generally produced an RMSE of 0.86-0.87, which was the third best in the class.

  </li>
  </ul>

All programs listed here are coded in Java.
<h2>Math</h2>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/shishir03/eulers-method">Euler's Method</a>: This program, coded in Python, solves an IVP (initial value problem) for a differential equation using Euler's method, which can be somewhat tedious when done by hand. The program allows you to set the initial conditions and adjust the number of steps used or the step size; more steps and a smaller step size lead to a more accurate result.</li>
  </ul>
<h2>Physics</h2>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/shishir03/ap_physics_atwood_simulation">Atwood Simulator</a>: I coded this program (in Java) for my AP Physics final project. Atwood machines are common physics problems, involving a system of two masses and a pulley. This simulator accounts for many variants of the problem, including a half-atwood (one mass is suspended), a full atwood (both masses are suspended), or a ramp atwood (one or both masses are on an incline). All the masses (including the pulley's mass) can be adjusted with sliders. The string's mass is negligible, and I didn't have enough time to implement friction on either the surfaces or in the pulley.
  </li>
  </ul>
<h2>Weather</h2>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/shishir03/wind_rose">Wind Rose</a>: I coded this program (in Java) in order to easily produce a wind rose plot of my weather data for a specified range of dates. A wind rose is a plot that shows the distribution of wind direction and wind speed over time. Making such a plot is not easy to do in a spreadsheet, so this program simplifies this task somewhat. However, it is best to stick to recent dates, as the Ambient Weather API stores data a few months ago at lower resolution, and completely archives data going back long enough.
  <li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/shishir03/weather-recorder">Weather Recorder</a>: This program automatically updates my spreadsheet of weather data every night close to midnight. Because it's a Google Script, it was primariy written in Javascript.
  </li>
  </ul>
<h2>Misc</h2>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/shishir03/google_news_feed">Google News Feed</a>: A <em>very</em> simplistic website that displays the top technology news of the day.</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/shishir03/minecraft-mapper">Minecraft Mapper</a>: This is a Minecraft plugin that can model the terrain of a small region (such as the Bay Area) in a Minecraft world (ideally superflat) by using the Google Maps Elevation API. Unfortunately, this program does not work anymore because my free trial for the API expired.</li>
</ul>
